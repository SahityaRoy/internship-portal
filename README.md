#### **Vision**

The Internship Marketplace smart contract is designed to bridge the gap between students and employers by providing a decentralized platform where employers can post internships, and students can apply for them. The platform aims to streamline the internship hiring process, ensuring that students are compensated fairly and transparently for their work, with all transactions secured on the blockchain.
